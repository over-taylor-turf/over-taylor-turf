## Coding Projects
👏 Check out some of my coding projects.

### ✨ My Bubbe Says 
Visit the **[live site](https://www.mybubbesays.com/#/)** and the **[github](https://github.com/over-taylor-turf/bubbe-says)** repository.<br /> 
⬆️ *My Bubbe Says* preserves cultural vocabulary for individuals who grew up in the American Jewish community, or for those who just watched a lot of Seinfeld at a young age! For Jewish Americans, the official teachers of the Yiddish language are often our grandmothers, bubbes, or grandfathers, zaides. *My Bubbe Says* constructs and keeps communal knowledge of words that might be otherwise lost or forgotten. 🗣

### ✨ Medpramin
Visit the **[live site](https://www.medpramin.com/#/)** and the **[github](https://github.com/over-taylor-turf/fake-drug-names)** repository.<br />
⬆️ *Medpramin* will randomize a drug name for you based on my own unique data set and then compare it to a real drug name provided by a medical API. Good luck guessing which one is real and which one is fake! Even the creator herself gets tricked. 🤣

### ✨ Hex Anderson 
Visit the **[live site](https://www.hexanderson.com/#/)** and the **[github](https://github.com/over-taylor-turf/hex-anderson)** repository.<br />
⬆️ *Hex Anderson* is a hex-code palette generator that uses Wes Anderson's design aesthetic and films as inspiration for unique color combinations. 🎨

### ✨ Portfolio Site
Visit the **[live site](https://www.stackoverturf.com/)** and the **[github](https://github.com/over-taylor-turf/over-taylor-turf.github.io)** repository.<br />
⬆️ *Stackoverturf* is my first, ever website as a developer! The code has been kept largely untouched, besides updating some links and photos in the 'projects' section. There are many, many improvements that could be made, but I am leaving it as a reminder of how far I've come as a developer and how far I will go. 🚀
