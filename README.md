# Hello, World! 🌎 I'm Taylor. 
My name is **Taylor Polli Overturf**. I am a former educator with a Master’s Degree in **Applied Linguistics** from Columbia University. I am deeply curious about **language acquisition**—whether it be a **human** or **computer** language. As such, a career as a developer—with infinite frameworks, libraries and languages to learn—excites me as an individual and a professional. I was an **ENL** (English as a New Language) **Teacher** for 7 years in New York City's Department of Education and I am currently an **Instructional Associate** for General Assembly. 

## Four Fun Facts about Taylor 
1. 😳 **My biggest fear**: accidentally eating one of those silica gel packets. 
2. 💻 **My current coding project**: a site that teaches, and preserves, Yiddish for a modern audience. 
3. 🐶 **My best friend**: a pitbull mix named Uma Thurman.
4. ⛳️ **My favorite sport**: I am the only person I know who genuinely loves watching golf...
